# Prompt 01 — Ansible bare minimum

Setup the minimum Ansible configuration to ping a target VM.
The Ansible conf as code must be inside a `_v01/ansible/` folder.

## Context

- Control node: this machine (root)
- Target node: `165.232.65.179`, accessible via `ssh root@165.232.65.179`
- Ping command: `ansible all -m ping -i inventory`

## Goal

Only create what is strictly necessary to run the ping command successfully:
- `inventory` file listing the target host
