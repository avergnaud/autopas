# Prompt 02 — Nginx + HTTPS + static web interface

Still in the `_v01` folder, implement the Ansible playbook to set up Nginx with
HTTPS (Let's Encrypt) serving a static Bootstrap web interface.

## Context

- Domain: `appsec.cc` already points to `165.232.65.179`
- All Ansible code lives in `_v01/ansible/`
- Target path for static files on server: `/opt/pas-assistant/web/`

## Goal

- Install Nginx and Certbot (`python3-certbot-nginx`)
- Obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate for `appsec.cc`
- Serve a static Bootstrap 5 placeholder page over HTTPS
- Redirect HTTP → HTTPS

## Out of scope (this step)

- No `proxy_pass` to FastAPI backend (port 8000) — backend does not exist yet.
  The reverse proxy config will be added in a later iteration.

## Files to create

```
_v01/ansible/
├── inventory                          (already exists)
├── playbook.yml
├── templates/
│   ├── nginx-http.conf.j2             pre-certbot: HTTP only
│   └── nginx-https.conf.j2            post-certbot: HTTPS + HTTP→HTTPS redirect
└── files/
    └── index.html                     Bootstrap 5 placeholder page
```

## Run command

```bash
cd _v01/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```
